! Description:
!
!   Module providing constant values needed by the photolysis component.
!
!   These are currently initialised to UM values in photol_init_configuration
!   but some of the constants are configurable by parent models to have
!   consistent values across the components.
!
! Part of the UKCA model, a community model supported by the
! Met Office and NCAS, with components provided initially
! by The University of Cambridge, University of Leeds and
! The Met. Office.  See www.ukca.ac.uk

! Code Description:
!   Language:  FORTRAN 2003
!   This code is written to UMDP3 programming standards.

! --- Constants used by Photolysis ---
! These will be initialised to current UM values but available to be
! overwritten by any parent model if necessary.
! These have a 'const_' prefix to avoid conflict with original variables in
! the codebase, but aliased in photol routines where these are actually used.
